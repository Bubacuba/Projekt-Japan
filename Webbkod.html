            <h2>Japanese Traditions</h2>
            <p>
                In Japan there are a variety of different traditions, some that might seem strange to foreigners. There are traditions related to etique or politeness while some other traditions are holidays, ceremonies and rituals.

        <h2>Obon Toro Nagashi 灯籠流し</h2>
        <div id = "text1">
            <p>A common festival that is celebrated in Japan in summer is named Obon. It is a three-day festival that celebrates the ancestors' spirits that come home to rest. It is the japanese tradition of floating lanterns in rivers known as Toro Nagashi. Obon is celebrated in summer because it is the time of the year when it’s believed that the spirit of the loved ones returns home. 
            </p>
        </div>
       <div id = "txtrandom">
           <p>Toro Nagashi officially begins at the moment the ancestors commence their return to the spirit world. Families come together to guide the spirits down to the sea using traditional candle-lit lanterns (toro). In the Japanese belief system, all humans originally came from water, so the lanterns visually represent the spirits’ return to the elements.
           </p>

           <p>Toro Nagashi is often referred to by the alternative name of the Festival of Recovery, which ties into the sad origins of the custom. It was first held in 1946 as a way to commemorate the lives lost in the US bombings of Tokyo and other Japanese cities during World War II. This is why you’ll find bigger public Toro Nagashi festivals at places such as Hiroshima, where 10,000 lanterns are set afloat. In Tokyo, the Asakusa celebration, held on the Sumida River, commemorates those lost to the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923.</p>

        <h2>Etiquette Bowing 
            お辞儀 </h2>
        <div id="text2">
            <p>An important tradition that many may know of is bowing. Bowing is a gesture used in a lot of situations in everyday life. Japanese people bow when they greet someone and when they take their leave. Bowing is a way to show respect and gain trust, the longer you bow means more respect. It is important to use proper etiquette when visiting Japan and bowing is one of the things to have in mind when greeting and leaving. </p>

            <h2>Onsen Hot Spring 温泉</h2>
            <div id ="text3">
                <p>Another common tradition in Japan is Onsen, which are hot spring public baths. In Japan there are plenty of active volcanoes and that makes Japan the prime spot for hot spring baths. A majority of Japanese onsen are nude-only to not risk contamination. </p>
                <p>Onsens are part of a sacred tradition. The introduction of Buddhism promoted ritual bathing as a part of being spiritually worthy and mindful, but even before Buddhism was introduced to the country, natural hot springs were regarded as a gift from the gods. Onsens drive Japanese tourism within the country, and many city-dwellers retreat to the remote outdoors in order to enjoy the quiet healing of beautiful views and warm mineral springs. In fact, over 46% of Japanese pleasure-seekers prefer a visit to the hot springs over travel overseas, a concert, or a movie.</p>
