    <h2>Japanese Traditions</h2>

    <div id = "introductiontxt">
    <pre>In Japan there are a variety of different traditions, some that might seem strange to foreigners. There are traditions related to etique or politeness while some other traditions are holidays, ceremonies and rituals. </pre>
    </div>

    <div id = "boxuno">
        <h2>Obon - Toro Nagashi</h2>
        <div id = "text1">
            <p>A common festival that is celebrated in Japan in summer is named Obon. It is a three-day festival that celebrates the ancestors' spirits that come home to rest. It is the japanese tradition of floating lanterns in rivers known as Toro Nagashi. Obon is celebrated in summer because it is the time of the year when it’s believed that the spirit of the loved ones returns home. 
            </p>

        <h2>Etiquette Bowing</h2>
        <div id = "text2">
            <p>An important tradition that many may know of is bowing. Bowing is a gesture used in a lot of situations in everyday life. Japanese people bow when they greet someone and when they take their leave. Bowing is a way to show respect and gain trust, the longer you bow means more respect. It is important to use proper etiquette when visiting Japan and bowing is one of the things to have in mind when greeting and leaving. </p>

        <div id = "boxtres">
            <h2>Onsen Hot Spring Baths</h2>
            <div id = "text3">
                <p>Another common tradition in Japan is Onsen, which are hot spring public baths. In Japan there are plenty of active volcanoes and that makes Japan the prime spot for hot spring baths. A majority of Japanese onsen are nude-only to not risk contamination. </p>

            <h2>Sights of Japan</h2>
            <p>Japan's landscape is extraordinary and so are their structures. One of the famous structures is the Himeji castle. It is to our knowledge, the  best preserved samurai castle and it is also the biggest one. Surrounded by sakura trees, it is one of the most famous sights in Japan.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="fuji">
        <p>Another incredible place to visit is Mount Fuji. It is Japan's largest mountain and is worshipped as a sacred place. It is a well shaped volcano with a height of 3776 meters and is still classified as an active volcano.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="zao">
        <p>If you’re not interested in structures or mountains a cool place to visit could be 
            the Zao Fox Village. This is a park where foxes walk around freely and you are allowed to hold some of them for a smaller charge. Don’t expect all of the foxes to be interested in you though since they mostly sleep and play.   
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tokyo">
         <p>   A really interesting structure for you to go and see is the Tokyo Tower. It looks a bit like the Eiffel Tower and is actually inspired by it. It is a red and white tower that works like a communication tower and can be climbed by visitors. 
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="kyoto">
           <p> The last site this text will take up is Imperial Kyoto. Kyoto is probably the most historical city or town in Japan. Its architecture has barely changed in a 1000 years. Even in the imperial times Kyoto was one of Japan's cultural centres and somehow it survived through the WWII devestations and therefore still stands with its remarkable old designs. 
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="endsights">
          <p>  There is plenty more to see in Japan and if you decide to travel there we are sure that you won’t regret it.
